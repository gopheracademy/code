## Web - Web Sockets

The web is changing and users are expecting fast, dynamic, and interactive web applications. Web Sockets allow for direct two-way communication between the front-end (JavaScript/HTML) and the back-end (Go).

## Notes

* The standard library has much of what you need to build services and apps.
* The http package provides the building blocks.
* There are other great packages in the Go ecosystem to help.
